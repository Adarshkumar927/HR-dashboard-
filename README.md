Highlights and features of dashboard 
-In recent months, our company faced a critical challenge: a sudden rise in employee attrition. Many employees left, signaling deeper issues that demanded attention. To address this, we built an HR Dashboard designed to uncover insights behind attrition through powerful visuals. A matrix table highlights employee service ratings, revealing satisfaction levels across departments. An age-wise bar graph uncovers retention gaps in specific age groups, while an education-wise column chart shows patterns in qualifications. Together, these insights empower HR to identify key pain points, implement targeted strategies, and ultimately reduce attrition while strengthening workforce stability and satisfaction.
